        <h2>About DAT VIBE APPAREL</h2>
        <p>
            DAT VIBE APPAREL was created to capture the energy, creativity, and authenticity of street culture. 
            Founded by <strong>DJ HookMan</strong>, a producer and artist known for his signature tag "<strong>HookMan with Dat Vibe</strong>", 
            the brand is a natural extension of his artistic vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            That tagline represents the vibe — the artistic ideal — behind everything DJ HookMan does. 
            DAT VIBE APPAREL channels that same energy into fashion, letting you wear the creativity, attitude, and culture that drives the music.
        </p>
        <p>
            From bold designs to quality apparel, DAT VIBE APPAREL is about expressing yourself and standing out. 
            Whether you’re on the streets, in the studio, or vibing with your crew, the brand lets the vibe speak for itself.
